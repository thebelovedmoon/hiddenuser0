1
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Let's continue.

2
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.700
I want to discuss your old time relationships.

3
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's get back to Louis. On 6th of July, half-past eight, you were with him.

4
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes.

5
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.300
Three days.

6
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Yes.

7
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
Tell me about him.

8
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.800
He is frenchman, 65 years old, 1.80m in height, balding. His company produces aerospace production...

9
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
Tell me more about his personal life.

10
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.800
He's married. He got 2 kids...

11
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.800
I meant, something more intimate.

12
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
How many times... you entered with him... into sexual... relations?

13
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I don't remember.

14
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
More than 5 times?

15
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Yes.

16
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.200
More than 10?

17
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Yes..

18
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Do you prefer quiet, gentle men like Louis?

19
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yes.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Can't hear you!

21
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.100
Yes!

22
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900
How it started each time?

23
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.800
Louis loved to undress me slowly.

24
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600
Go on.

25
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.600
To kiss my body.

26
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.900
Which parts?

27
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
My neck, shoulders.

28
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.800
Where else?

29
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
My stomach, breasts, hips.

30
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.500
He was very susceptible to your reactions?

31
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Yes.

32
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:48.000
In another words.. you want to tell me... that for Louis yours pleasure were more important than his?

33
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Yes.

34
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now tell me about the drugs you are taking each day. Describe each of it, starting from Monday.

35
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
The faster you tell me, the faster it will ends.

36
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.900
I already told you many times.

37
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.800
Tell me again.

38
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.000
On Monday I took a white pill, after the dinner.

39
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
What is this pill for?

40
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
I don't know!

41
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Go on.

42
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.200
On Tuesday I took the red and white pills, after the morning physical exercises.

43
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.700
And that's all?

44
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.000
No. Later I took a liquid medicine before the sleep.

45
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Do you know what are these drugs for?

46
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.300
I don't.

47
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.300
Go on.

48
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.000
I didn't took anything on Wednesday. On Thursday I took a little green pill.

49
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.300
Did you ever forget to take it?

50
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
No. One of the guardians brings me these drugs when I wake up.

51
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.700
And he was watching you taking these drugs?

52
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.100
Yes.

53
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.100
So you never forget to take it?

54
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.200
No.

55
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.700
Was it ever difficult to swallow it?

56
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
No.

57
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Did you ever vomit after taking this green pill?

58
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.300
No.

59
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.200
Never?

60
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.400
Never.

61
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Do you know what is this pill for?

62
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.200
No. I have no idea.

63
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.500
And what you think it's for?

64
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.700
I don't know.

65
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.100
Then guess!

66
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
For making my skin soft.

67
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.100
Ghmm

68
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000
During last few months... did you ever have... bloody... secretions?

69
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Did you have bloody secretions?

70
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.200
I already answered this question to doctors.

71
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.500
But now I'm asking you!

72
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.200
No.

73
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.100
And in your whole life, did you ever have bloody secretions?

74
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.100
There is nothing shameful about that.

75
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.100
No.

76
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.500
I can't help you, if you don't tell me the truth.

77
00:08:08.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I have never noticed any of bloody secretions.
